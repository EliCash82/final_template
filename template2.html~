<h1>Paper Main Title</h1>
<h3>Section 1</h3>
<p>This is a paragraph from my paper.  This is stuff I am writing
in that paragraph.  Isn't this interesting stuff?  Now I'm going
to quote a source</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a long quote by someone that I am going
to contextualize in my next paragraph (Evans 35).</blockquote>

<p>This is another paragraph, any time I want to italicize something
I create <i>this tag</i>.  Any time I want something bold, why I do
something very similar, I open and close <strong>this tag</strong></p>

<h3>Another subheading</h3>

<p>Now I'm going to continue writing the paragraphs of my paper like
this.  It sure is nice that if I misspell something I can use atom to 
correct the spelling.  If that doesn't work automatically I can just
hit the "Settings" in the menu bar, and search for the spell check
package.  Once I install that I can see spelling mistakes with a red
underline just like in microsoft word.  If I need to correct it I have
to highlight the word by double clicking on it.</p>

<p><img src="image.png"><br/>Above the break is an image.  Funny how
breaks and horizontal lines are the only things that don't have opening
AND closing tags.  At least on this page.</p>

<p>Now I've got a short quote I'm going to include in this paragraph,
how shall I do it?  How about like this... and Jim said, <blockquote>"That is a great idea."(Johnson 32).</blockquote></p>
